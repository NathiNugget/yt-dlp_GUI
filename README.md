# yt-dlp_GUI
A repository consisting of my attemp at creating a user-friendly GUI for yt-dlp. 
This program assumes you're on Windows platform and have installed both yt-dlp and FFMPeg on your path. 
Without these, the program simply doesn't work and you should look elsewhere, or, with enough wishes for it I just might make a Mac or Linux release
